<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Created it with Vite, Vue.js, and TailwindCSS. The Vue.js I'm using is v.3, one of the changes in Vue v.3 is that I can now write directly to the "template" tag without wrapping it in a div. TailwindCSS uses a JIT feature so I can dynamically set the size via class name.

What I failed to implement was setting the title to fit the page dynamically, in this case, I directly named it in the parent file (./index.html).
